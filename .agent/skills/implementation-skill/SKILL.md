## Implementation Flow
When implementing a new feature, task, or code modification, you MUST follow these steps in order:
1. **Read Documentations:** Review available context and coding styles.
2. **Clarify Requirements:** Ask yes or no questions for clarification and recommendations before starting.
3. **Implement:** Execute the task ONLY when approved by the user.
4. **Testing:** Create test cases for the implemented code.
5. **Run Tests:** Execute tests and proactively fix any resulting issues.
6. **Documentation:** Ask for approval on the implemented code, and once approved, create or update relevant documentation.
